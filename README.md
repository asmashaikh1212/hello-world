# hello-world
My very first repository
Am I supposed to write some code here?
Hello? GitHub sounds really interesting but how long will it take for a novice like me to learn to use it?

I am Asma from Pune, India. I want to be a programmer and today, that is, the 8th of July, 2017, ismy first day at GitHub.
